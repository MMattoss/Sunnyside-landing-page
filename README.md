I really can't get enough of these Frontend Mentor challenges!
This one was the most fun to make so far. Learned a lot about styling specifics elements with inherit selectors like :nth-child (), the pseudo-element ::after and how to create full pages since all the other challenges I made before this one where just floating cards in the middle of the screen. I'm still yet to figure out how to make the pop-up menu in the mobile version and there is still a lot to learn about making the page's responsiveness better but so far I'm very happy with the results!
